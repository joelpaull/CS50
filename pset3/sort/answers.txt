Throughout below determinations;
    As most steps required in sorting of random50000, this time corresponds to BigO notation.
    As least steps required in sorting of sorted50000, this time corresponds to omega notation.

sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?:
    Sort1 recorded time to sort random50000; ~7.5s
    Sort1 recorded time to sort sorted50000; ~0.5s
    Bubble sort has BigO notation O(n^2), and omega notation theta(n), as random50000 time is much larger than sorted50000 it is conculded this is bubble sort alogrithm.
    Other two algorithms are assigned theta notations so both ordered and random times will be similar when using same sort algorithm (not the case here).

sort2 uses: Merge sort


How do you know?:
    Sort2 recorded time to sort random50000; ~0.5s
    Sort2 recorded time to sort sorted50000; ~0.5s
    Merge sort is faster than selection sort, but both have theta notations so random and sorted times are similar.
    Comparing Sort2 times against that of Sort3 (~3.5s) determines Sort2 is faster and therefore can be assigned as merge sort.


sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?:
    Sort3 recorded time to sort random50000; ~3.5s
    Sort3 recorded time to sort sorted50000; ~3.5s
    The argument of Sort2 allows for the assiging of this Sort algorithm as selection sort.
